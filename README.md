Simple implementation of Google Maps using TypeScript.  

To run:  
From the top level of the directory:  
in index.html, replace "<API-KEY-GOES-HERE>" with a working API key.  
type "npm i" in Terminal to install dependencies, then:  
type parcel index.html to run parcel (which handles TypeScript compilation.)
